# Spoil Me Not

 With this Chrome extension you can remove spoilers for given shows from the pages you visit by blurring them out. 
 The extension was developed for a software engineering project at SMU and makes use of machine learning on the backend 
 to dynamically generate keywords to blue out. The extension will unfortunately loose support soon due to the cost of 
 hosting the servers. If you'd stil like to try this extension out and see what it looks like, simply add the 
 PURE_JS_Extension folder as an unpacked extension in chrome to enable it.
